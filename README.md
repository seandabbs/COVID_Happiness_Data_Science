# COVID Happiness Data Science
 This interactive web page explores data from the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/#appendices-and-data">World Happiness Report</a> for the years leading up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was for a data science class project in which students could use their choice of data science platform to create a visualization. I chose to use <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3">d3.js</a> along with other vanilla JS and CSS. The single-page app provides parallax scrolling, animations, interactive tooltips, and menus as the user explores the data from several perspectives.
